# pullToReach

My approach to create a pull to reach navigation for swiftUI!

I created this to see how far I can push swiftUI and if it is possible to get "pull to reach" working. In general it is possible however the user experience is poor and the code also.

I think it would be possible to make it fully functional with a little more combine code, but I have stopped working on it for now because there is no good way to track touches and the movement of the list.
