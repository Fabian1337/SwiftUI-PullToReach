# pullToReach

My aproche to create a pull to reach navigation for swiftUI!

Don't use it ! It is bad code ! 

I created this to see how far I can push swiftUI and if it is possible to get pull to reach working. Basicly it is possible but it is not nice user expiriance and it isn't nice code. I think I would be possible to get it fully working with some more combine code but I stoped working on this for now because there in't a a good way to track touches and the list movement
